Newport argues that this advice is wrong and that, in reality, building valuable skills is the key to creating a career that is both fulfilling and financially rewarding.\r\n\r\nThe book begins by debunking the myth of the \"passion hypothesis,\" which holds that people who are passionate about their work are more likely to be successful and happy. Newport argues that this myth is based on a misunderstanding of what passion is and how it develops. He cites research showing that people who are successful in their careers are not necessarily passionate about their work from the start, but rather develop passion over time as they become more skilled and competent.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the passion hypothesis, Newport proposes the \"craftsman mindset,\" which holds that the key to finding work you love is to become so good at something that you become valuable to others. He argues that this requires a focus on developing valuable skills, rather than trying to find work that aligns with your preexisting passions.\r\n\r\nTo support this argument, Newport discusses the concept of \"career capital,\" which refers to the skills and knowledge that you have that make you valuable to others. He argues that building career capital is the key to creating a fulfilling and successful career, and offers a set of strategies for doing so. These strategies include finding a mentor, networking, and learning new skills.\r\n\r\nOverall, So Good They Can\'t Ignore You is a thought-provoking book that challenges traditional assumptions about how to find work you love. It offers a fresh perspective on the importance of building valuable skills and suggests that the key to a fulfilling career is not necessarily finding your passion, but rather becoming so good at something that you become valuable to others.', 'uthmeene', 27, 'Cal Newport', 1, 'One of the most important skills to develop in today\'s economy is the ability to learn new things quickly. This ability is particularly valuable because the most in-demand industries are changing rapidly, and the most successful workers are those who can adapt and learn new skills as needed.\r\n\r\nTo develop this ability, you need to cultivate a \"growth mindset.\" This means that you should view your skills and abilities as something that can be developed and improved over time, rather than something that is fixed and unchanging. This mindset is important because it allows you to embrace challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth, rather than seeing them as failures.\r\n\r\nTo cultivate a growth mindset, you should focus on learning new things and taking on challenging tasks. This can involve seeking out new experiences, taking on new responsibilities at work, or learning new skills through formal education or training. The key is to embrace challenges and see them as opportunities to grow and learn, rather than as threats to your self-worth.\"', 'The Passion Hypothesis\r\n\r\nThe Craftsman Mindset\r\n\r\nThe Little Principles of Success\r\n\r\nThe Law of Financial Viability\r\n\r\nThe Two Core Abilities for Thriving in the New Economy\r\n\r\nTurn Down a Promotion?\r\n\r\nFollow Your Passion?

It advocates for financial literacy and the importance of building wealth through investing, real estate, and entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nThe book presents the story of Kiyosaki\'s upbringing and how he was influenced by two men in his life: his biological father, who was a poor and uneducated man, and his best friend\'s father, who was wealthy and successful. The \"rich dad\" of the title refers to Kiyosaki\'s friend\'s father, while the \"poor dad\" refers to Kiyosaki\'s own father.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, Kiyosaki compares and contrasts the financial advice and attitudes of these two men, and he advocates for the principles and strategies espoused by the \"rich dad.\" These include the importance of financial literacy, the power of entrepreneurship and investing, and the dangers of relying on traditional forms of employment and saving for financial security.\r\n\r\nRich Dad Poor Dad has become a best-seller and has inspired many people to take control of their finances and build wealth.

This image could be used to represent the contrast between the rich \"dad\" and the poor \"dad\" in the book, and could be accompanied by text or other visual elements to further convey the key ideas and messages of the book.

The book argues that the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare and valuable in today\'s economy, as the distractions of the digital age make it harder for people to concentrate and produce valuable work. Newport offers a set of rules and strategies for cultivating deep work in oneself, as well as tips for managing one\'s time and attention in an age of constant distractions.\r\n\r\nThe book begins by defining deep work and explaining why it is important in today\'s economy. Newport argues that deep work is necessary for producing valuable and meaningful work, and that it is becoming increasingly rare as more and more people struggle to focus in an age of constant distractions. He cites research showing that the ability to focus without distraction is a key predictor of success in a wide range of fields, and that people who are able to perform deep work are able to produce more in less time than those who are easily distracted.\r\n\r\nNewport then offers a set of strategies for cultivating deep work in oneself. He recommends setting clear goals and priorities, creating a structured schedule for deep work, and establishing clear routines and rituals to help facilitate focused work. He also suggests finding a place to work that is conducive to deep work, such as a quiet office or a library, and minimizing distractions by turning off notifications and avoiding unnecessary interruptions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these strategies for cultivating deep work, the book also offers tips for managing one\'s time and attention in an age of constant distractions. Newport recommends batching similar tasks together, setting limits on the amount of time spent on shallow tasks, and using tools and techniques to minimize distractions and interruptions. He also suggests setting clear boundaries around work and leisure, and taking regular breaks to rest and recharge.\r\n\r\nOverall, Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World is a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their productivity and focus in an age of constant distractions. It offers a clear and concise set of strategies for cultivating deep work in oneself, as well as tips for managing one\'s time and attention in an age of constant distractions.', 'uthmeene', 27, 'Cal Newport', 1, '\"In the Deep Work Hypothesis, I propose that the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.\"\r\n\r\n\"To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction. Put another way, the type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work. If you‚Äôre not comfortable with this idea, or you think that your job doesn‚Äôt require this type of depth, consider that the most successful people in the most valuable industries all face the same constraint: they‚Äôre all extremely busy. To thrive in this new economy, therefore, you must be able to perform deep work.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are entering an era in which the traditional methods for developing and showcasing your skills are becoming less valuable. Instead of mastering a specific skill set, you should seek to learn how to learn new skills quickly. This means that you should prioritize learning over doing. Doing is important, but if you‚Äôre not learning while you do, you‚Äôre falling behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many strategies you can use to cultivate a deep work practice, but the most effective is to create a ‚Äúritual‚Äù around it. This involves creating a specific set of conditions and rules for yourself that govern how you work during deep work sessions. These rules might include specifying the location where you‚Äôll work, the time of day you‚Äôll work, the types of activities you‚Äôll do during breaks, and so on.\"\r\n\r\n\"In general, the more consistently you use your deep work rituals, the more powerful they become.

The book, written by Cal Newport, argues that the constant digital communication that characterizes the workdays of many modern knowledge workers is a productivity disaster, reducing profitability and slowing economic growth. It also suggests that this \"hyperactive hive mind\" workflow can lead to feelings of anxiety and unhappiness.\r\n\r\nNewport presents a series of principles and concrete instructions for fixing this broken approach to work and creating a more mindful and strategic approach to communication. This involves limiting the use of digital communication tools like email and instead focusing on more substantive work, as well as finding ways to disconnect and recharge. The goal is to streamline important communication and shift away from an inbox-driven workday, where tasks are identified, assigned, and reviewed through clear processes rather than haphazard messaging.\r\n\r\nThe book advocates for a workplace in which each person works on fewer things but does them better, and in which support is invested in aggressively in order to reduce the burden of administrative tasks. Newport argues that the evolution of the knowledge sector beyond the hyperactive hive mind is inevitable, and that the question is not whether a world without email is coming (it is), but whether you will be ahead of this trend. If you are a CEO seeking a competitive edge, an entrepreneur convinced that your productivity could be higher, or an employee exhausted by your inbox, A World Without Email will convince you that the time has come for bold changes and will walk you through exactly how to make them happen.', 'uthmeene', 27, 'Cal Newport', 1, '<center>\r\nRead an Excerpt\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe Hyperactive Hive Mind\r\n\r\nIn late 2010, Nish Acharya arrived in Washington, DC, ready to work. President Barack Obama had appointed Nish to be his director of innovation and entrepreneurship and a senior adviser to the secretary of commerce. Nish was asked to coordinate with twenty-six different federal agencies and over five hundred universities to dispense $100 million in funding, meaning that he was about to become the prototypical DC power player: smartphone always in hand, messages flying back and forth at all hours. But then the network broke.\r\n\r\nOn a Tuesday morning, just a couple of months into his new role, Nish received an email from his CTO explaining that they had to temporarily shut down their office‚Äôs network due to a computer virus. ‚ÄúWe all expected that this would be fixed in a couple of days,‚Äù Nish told me when I later interviewed him about the incident. But this prediction proved wildly optimistic. The following week, an undersecretary of commerce convened a meeting. She explained that they suspected the virus infecting their network came from a foreign power, and that Homeland Security was recommending that the network stay down while they traced the attack. Just to be safe, they were also going to destroy all the computers, laptops, printers‚Äîanything with a chip‚Äîin the office.\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest impacts of this network shutdown was that the office lost the ability to send or receive emails. For security purposes, it was illegal for them to use personal email addresses to perform their government work, and bureaucratic hurdles kept them from setting up temporary accounts using other agencies‚Äô networks. Nish and his team were effectively cut off from the frenetic ping-pong of digital chatter that defines most high-level work within the federal government. The blackout lasted six weeks. With a touch of gallows humor, they took to calling the fateful day when it all began ‚ÄúDark Tuesday.‚Äù\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the sudden and unexpected loss of email made certain parts of Nish‚Äôs work ‚Äúquite hellish.‚Äù Because the rest of the government continued to rely heavily on this tool, he often worried about missing important meetings or requests. ‚ÄúThere was an existing information pipeline,‚Äù he explained, ‚Äúand I was out of the loop.‚Äù Another hardship was logistics. Nish‚Äôs job required him to set up many meetings, and this task was made substantially more annoying without the ability to coordinate over email.\r\n\r\nPerhaps less expected, however, was that Nish‚Äôs work didn‚Äôt grind to a halt during these six weeks. He instead began to notice that he was actually getting better at his job. Lacking the ability to simply send a quick email when he had a question, he took to leaving his office to meet with people in person. Because these appointments were a pain to arrange, he scheduled longer blocks of time, allowing him to really get to know the people he was meeting and understand the nuances of their issues. As Nish explained, these extended sessions proved ‚Äúvery valuable‚Äù for a new political appointee trying to learn the subtle dynamics of the federal government.\r\n\r\nThe lack of an inbox to check between these meetings opened up cognitive downtime‚Äîwhat Nish took to calling ‚Äúwhitespace‚Äù‚Äîto dive more deeply into the research literature and legislation relevant to the topics handled by his office. This slower and more thoughtful approach to thinking yielded a pair of breakthrough ideas that ended up setting the agenda for Nish‚Äôs agency for the entire year that followed. ‚ÄúIn the Washington politic environment, no one gives themselves that space,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all neurotic looking at your phone, checking email‚Äîit hurts ingenuity.‚Äù\r\n\r\nAs I talked to Nish about Dark Tuesday and its aftermath, it occurred to me that many of the hardships that made the blackout ‚Äúhellish‚Äù seemed solvable. Nish admitted, for example, that his concern about being out of the loop was largely alleviated by the simple habit of calling the White House each day to learn if there were any meetings he needed to know about. Presumably, a dedicated assistant or junior team member could handle this call. The other issue was the annoyance of scheduling meetings, but this could also be handled by an assistant or some sort of automated scheduling system. It seemed, in other words, that it might be possible to preserve the profound benefits of the email blackout while avoiding many of the accompanying annoyances.\r\n‚ÄúWhat would you think of this way of working?‚Äù I asked after explaining my proposed fixes. The phone line went silent for a moment. I had pitched an idea so preposterous‚Äîpermanently working without email‚Äîthat Nish‚Äôs mind had temporarily frozen.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nNish‚Äôs reaction was not surprising. A widely accepted premise of modern knowledge work is that email saved us: transforming stodgy, old-fashioned offices, filled with secretaries scribbling phone messages and paper memos delivered from mail carts, into something sleeker and more efficient. According to this premise, if you feel overwhelmed by tools like email or instant messenger, it‚Äôs because your personal habits are sloppy: you need to batch your inbox checks, and turn off your notifications, and write clearer subject lines! If inbox overload gets really bad, then maybe your organization as a whole needs to tweak their ‚Äúnorms‚Äù around issues like response time expectations. The underlying value of the constant electronic communication that defines modern work, however, is never questioned, as this would be hopelessly reactionary and nostalgic, like pining for the lost days of horse transport or the romance of candlelight.\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, Nish‚Äôs Dark Tuesday experience was a disaster. But what if we have this exactly backward? What if email didn‚Äôt save knowledge work but instead accidentally traded minor conveniences for a major drag on real productivity (not frantic busyness, but actual results), leading to slower economic growth over the past two decades? What if our problems with these tools don‚Äôt come from easily fixable bad habits and loose norms, but instead from the way they dramatically and unexpectedly changed the very nature of how we work? What if Dark Tuesday, in other words, was not a disaster, but instead a preview of how the most innovative executives and entrepreneurs will be organizing their work in the very near future?\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nI‚Äôve been obsessed with studying how email broke work for at least the past half decade. An important inflection point in this journey was in 2016, when I published a book titled Deep Work, which went on to become a surprise hit. This book argued that the knowledge sector was undervaluing concentration. While the ability to rapidly communicate using digital messages is useful, the frequent disruptions created by this behavior also make it hard to focus, which has a bigger impact on our ability to produce valuable output than we may have realized. I didn‚Äôt spend much time in Deep Work trying to understand how we ended up drowning in our inboxes, or suggesting systemic changes. I thought this problem was largely one of insufficient information. Once organizations realized the importance of focus, I reasoned, they could easily correct their operations to make it a priority.\r\n\r\nI discovered that I was overly optimistic. As I toured the country talking about my book, meeting with both executives and employees, and writing more about these topics on my blog, as well as in the pages of publications like The New York Times and The New Yorker, I encountered a grimmer and more nuanced understanding of the current state of the knowledge sector. Constant communication is not something that gets in the way of real work; it has instead become totally intertwined in how this work actually gets done‚Äîpreventing easy efforts to reduce distractions through better habits or short-lived management stunts like email-free Fridays. Real improvement, it became clear, would require fundamental change to how we organize our professional efforts. It also became clear that these changes can‚Äôt come too soon: whereas email overload emerged as a fashionable annoyance in the early 2000s, it has recently advanced into a much more serious problem, reaching a saturation point for many in which their actual productive output gets squeezed into the early morning, or evenings and weekends, while their workdays devolve into Sisyphean battles against their inboxes‚Äîa uniquely misery-inducing approach to getting things done.\r\n\r\nThis book is my attempt to tackle this crisis. To pull together‚Äîfor the first time‚Äîeverything we now know about how we ended up in a culture of constant communication, and the effects it‚Äôs having on both our productivity and mental health, as well as to explore our most compelling visions for what alternative forms of work might look like. The idea of a world without email was radical enough to catch Nish Acharya off guard. But I‚Äôve come to believe it‚Äôs not only possible, but actually inevitable, and my goal with this book is to provide a blueprint for this coming revolution. Before I can better summarize what to expect in the pages ahead, we must start with a clearer understanding of the problem we currently face.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAs email spread through the professional world in the 1980s and ‚Äô90s, it introduced something novel: low-friction communication at scale. With this new tool, the cost in terms of time and social capital to communicate with anyone related to your job plummeted from significant to almost nothing. As the writer Chris Anderson notes in his 2009 book Free, the dynamics of reducing a cost to zero can be ‚Äúdeeply mysterious,‚Äù[1] which helps explain why few predicted the changes unleashed by this arrival of free communication. We didn‚Äôt just shift our existing volume of voicemails, faxes, and memos to this new, more convenient electronic medium; we completely transformed the underlying workflow that determines how our daily efforts unfold. We began to talk back and forth much more than we ever had before, smoothing out the once coarse sequence of discrete work activities that defined our day into a more continuous spread of ongoing chatter, blending with and softening what we used to think of as our actual work.\r\n\r\nOne study estimates that by 2019 the average worker was sending and receiving 126 business emails per day, which works out to about one message every four minutes.[2] A software company called RescueTime recently measured this behavior directly using time tracking software and calculated that their users were checking email or instant messenger tools like Slack once every six minutes on average.[3] A team from the University of California, Irvine ran a similar experiment, tracking the computer behavior of forty employees at a large company over twelve workdays. They found that the workers checked their inboxes an average of seventy-seven times a day, with the heaviest user checking more than four hundred times daily.[4] A survey conducted by Adobe revealed that knowledge workers self-report spending more than three hours a day sending and receiving business email.[5]\r\n\r\nThe issue, then, is not the tool but the new way of working it introduced. To help us better understand this new workflow, I‚Äôll give it a name and definition:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hyperactive Hive Mind\r\nA workflow centered on ongoing conversation fueled by unstructured and unscheduled messages delivered through digital communication tools like email and instant messenger services.\r\n\r\nThe hyperactive hive mind workflow has become ubiquitous in the knowledge sector. Whether you‚Äôre a computer programmer, marketing consultant, manager, newspaper editor, or professor, your day is now largely structured around tending your organization‚Äôs ongoing hive mind conversation. It‚Äôs this workflow that causes us to spend over a third of our working hours in our inbox, checking for new messages every six minutes. We‚Äôre used to this now, but when viewed in the context of even recent history, it represents a shift in our work culture that‚Äôs so radical it would be absurd to allow it to escape closer scrutiny.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, the hyperactive hive mind is not obviously a bad idea. Among the benefits of this workflow is the fact that it‚Äôs simple and incredibly adaptive. As one researcher explained to me, part of email‚Äôs appeal was that this one easy tool could be applied to almost every type of knowledge work‚Äîa much smaller learning curve than needing to master a separate bespoke digital system for each type of work. Unstructured conversation is also an effective method for identifying unexpected challenges and quickly coordinating responses.\r\n\r\nBut as I‚Äôll argue in part 1 of this book, the hyperactive hive mind workflow enabled by email‚Äîalthough natural‚Äîhas turned out to be spectacularly ineffective. The explanation for this failure can be found in our psychology. Beyond the very small scale (say, two or three people), this style of unstructured collaboration simply doesn‚Äôt mesh well with the way the human brain has evolved to operate. If your organization depends on the hive mind, then you cannot neglect your inbox or chat channels for long without slowing down the entire operation. This constant interaction with the hive mind, however, requires that you frequently switch your attention from your work to talking about work, and then back again. As I‚Äôll detail, pioneering research in psychology and neuroscience reveals that these context switches, even if brief, induce a heavy cost in terms of mental energy‚Äîreducing cognitive performance and creating a sense of exhaustion and reduced efficacy. In the moment, the ability to quickly delegate tasks or solicit feedback might seem like an act of streamlining, but as I‚Äôll show, in the long run, it‚Äôs likely reducing productivity, requiring more time and more expenses to get the same total amount of work accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn this first part of the book, I‚Äôll also detail how the social element of the hive mind workflow clashes with the social circuits in our brains. Rationally, you know that the six hundred unread messages in your inbox are not crucial, and you remind yourself that the senders of these messages have better things to do than wait expectantly, staring at their screens and cursing the latency of your response. But a deeper part of your brain, evolved to tend the careful dance of social dynamics that has allowed our species to thrive so spectacularly since the Paleolithic, remains concerned by what it perceives to be neglected social obligations. As far as these social circuits are concerned, members of your tribe are trying to get your attention and you‚Äôre ignoring them: an event that registers as an emergency. The result of this constant state of unease is a low-grade background hum of anxiety that many inbox-bound knowledge workers have come to assume is unavoidable, but is actually an artifact of this unfortunate mismatch between our modern tools and ancient brains.\r\n\r\nThe obvious question is why we would ever adopt a workflow that comes with so many negative features. As I explain at the end of part 1, the story behind the rise of the hyperactive hive mind is complicated. No one really decided that it was a good idea; it instead arose, in some sense, of its own volition. Our belief that frenetic communication is somehow synonymous with work is largely a backfilled narrative we tell ourselves to make sense of sudden changes driven by complex dynamics.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the arbitrariness behind how we currently work, perhaps more than anything else, should motivate us to seek better options. This is exactly the goal I take on in part 2 of the book. In this second part, I introduce a framework I call attention capital theory that argues for creating workflows built around processes specifically designed to help us get the most out of our human brains while minimizing unnecessary miseries. This might sound obvious, but it actually contradicts the standard way of thinking about knowledge work management. As I‚Äôll show, driven by the ideas of the immensely influential business thinker Peter Drucker, we tend to think of knowledge workers as autonomous black boxes‚Äîignoring the details of how they get their work done and focusing instead on providing them clear objectives and motivational leadership. This is a mistake. There is massive potential productivity currently latent in the knowledge sector. To unlock it will require much more systematic thinking about how best to organize the fundamental objective of getting a collection of human brains hooked together in networks to produce the most possible valuable output in the most sustainable way. Hint: the right answer is unlikely to involve checking email once every six minutes.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of part 2 explores a collection of principles for applying attention capital theory to rebuild the workflows that drive organizational, team, and individual work in this direction‚Äîmoving us away from the hyperactive hive mind and toward more structured approaches that avoid the problems of constant communication detailed in part 1. Some of the ideas supporting these principles come from cutting-edge examples of organizations experimenting with novel workflows that minimize unscheduled communication. Other ideas are drawn from the practices that enabled complex knowledge organizations to function effectively in an age before digital networks.\r\n\r\nThe principles described in part 2 don‚Äôt insist that you banish messaging technologies like email or instant messenger. These tools remain a very useful way to communicate, and it would be reactionary to return to older and less convenient technologies just to make a point. But these principles will push you to reduce digital messaging from a constant presence to something that occurs more occasionally. The world without email referenced in the title of this book, therefore, is not a place in which protocols like SMTP and POP3 are banished. It is, however, a place where you spend most of your day actually working on hard things instead of talking about this work, or endlessly bouncing small tasks back and forth in messages.\r\n\r\nThis advice is designed to apply to many audiences. This includes business leaders looking to overhaul their company‚Äôs operation, teams looking to function more efficiently, solo entrepreneurs and freelancers looking to maximize their value production, and even individual employees looking to get more out of their individual communication habits by viewing them through the perspective of attention capital. Accordingly, my examples span from the large scale, such as CEOs making drastic changes to their company‚Äôs culture, to the small scale, such as my own experiments with using systems borrowed from software development to move my academic administrative tasks out of my inbox and into a more organized format.\r\n\r\nNot every suggestion in part 2 applies to every situation. If you‚Äôre an employee of a company that still worships at the altar of the hyperactive hive mind, for example, there are only so many changes you can make on your own without infuriating your coworkers. Some care will therefore be needed in picking and choosing the strategies you implement. (I attempt to help you in this selection by highlighting examples of how the various principles have applied in the individual context.) Similarly, if you‚Äôre a start-up entrepreneur, you‚Äôre better able to experiment with radical new work processes than if you‚Äôre the CEO of a large company.\r\n\r\nBut I firmly believe that any individual or organization who starts to think critically about the hyperactive hive mind workflow, then systematically replaces elements of it with processes that are more compatible with the realities of the human brain, will generate a substantial competitive edge. The future of work is increasingly cognitive. This means that the sooner we take seriously how human brains actually function, and seek out strategies that best complement these realities, the sooner we‚Äôll realize that the hyperactive hive mind, though convenient, is a disastrously ineffective way to organize our efforts.\r\n\r\nThis book, therefore, should not be understood as reactionary or anti-technology. To the contrary, its message is profoundly future-oriented. It recognizes that if we want to extract the full potential of digital networks in professional settings, we must continually and aggressively try to optimize how we use them. Attacking the flaws of the hyperactive hive mind is decidedly not an act of Luddism‚Äîif anything, the true obstruction to progress is giving in to the simplistic comforts of this blunt workflow at the expense of further refinement.\r\n\r\nIn this formulation, a world without email is not a step backward but a step forward into an exciting technological future we‚Äôre only just beginning to understand. Knowledge work does not yet have its Henry Ford, but workflow innovations with impact on the same scale as the assembly line are inevitable. I can‚Äôt predict all the details of this future, but I‚Äôm convinced it will not involve checking an inbox every six minutes. This world without email is coming, and I hope this book will get you as excited about its potential as I am.\r\n\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<div class=\'note\'>\r\n ALL RIGHTS RESERVERD FOR THE AUTHOR ¬© Cal Newport\r\n</div>', 'Table of Contents\r\nIntroduction: The Hyperactive Hive Mind xi\r\n\r\nPart 1 The Case Against Email 1\r\n\r\n1 Email Reduces Productivity 3\r\n\r\n2 Email Makes Us Miserable 35\r\n\r\n3 Email Has a Mind of Its Own 63\r\n\r\nPart 2 Principles for a World Without Email 95\r\n\r\n4 The Attention Capital Principle 97\r\n\r\n5 The Process Principle 135\r\n\r\n6 The Protocol Principle 179\r\n\r\n7 The Specialization Principle 215\r\n\r\nConclusion: The Twenty-First-Century Moonshot 257\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments 263\r\n\r\nNotes 265\r\n\r\nIndex 283', 'Discover the ultimate solution to workplace productivity and well-being with A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication Overload.

The French press had been hounding him all week, and the press conference this afternoon had been a disaster.\r\n\r\nHe had come to Paris to speak about his new book, The Symbology of Sacred Architecture, but the reporters had been more interested in grilling him about the controversy surrounding his previous work, The Lost Symbol.

And why? As they approached the curator\'s office, Langdon could see a group of police officers huddled outside the door, talking in hushed tones. One of them turned as Langdon approached.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Langdon?\" the officer said, stepping forward. \"I am Captain Bezu Fache, chief investigator for the Judicial Police.

Emma is intelligent, energetic, and headstrong, and she takes great pleasure in trying to play matchmaker for those around her. However, her well-intentioned interference often leads to complications and misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nThe novel follows Emma as she navigates the social and romantic expectations of her time. Along the way, she meets a cast of colorful characters, including Mr. Knightley, a wealthy landowner and Emma\'s older brother-in-law; Mr. Elton, a vain and foppish clergyman; and Harriet Smith, a sweet and naive young woman whom Emma takes under her wing.\r\n\r\nAs Emma becomes more involved in the lives of those around her, she begins to realize that her own feelings and desires may not be as clear as she thought. She must learn to listen to her heart and make her own choices, rather than relying on the expectations of others.\r\n\r\nOne of the strengths of Emma is Austen\'s skillful character development.

Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\r\n\r\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\'s family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor\'s judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.\r\n\r\nThe real evils, indeed, of Emma\'s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.', 'Introduction to Emma Woodhouse and her life in the village of Highbury\r\n\r\nEmma meets Harriet Smith and becomes determined to find her a suitable husband\r\n\r\nEmma\'s attempts to match Harriet with Mr. Elton go awry, leading to misunderstandings and complications\r\n\r\nEmma becomes friends with Frank Churchill, a charming young man with a mysterious past\r\n\r\nEmma\'s relationship with Mr. Knightley, her older brother-in-law, becomes strained due to her interference in the lives of those around her\r\n\r\nEmma begins to realize her own feelings and the errors of her ways\r\n\r\nThe resolution of various romantic entanglements and Emma\'s personal growth.', '\"Emma\" by Jane Austen is a classic novel that tells the story of the wealthy and headstrong young woman, Emma Woodhouse, as she navigates the expectations of 19th century English society.

The book is divided into six sections: laws 1-16 deal with laws for gaining power, laws 17-29 focus on laws for maintaining power, laws 30-35 cover laws for creating power, laws 36-45 deal with laws for using power, and laws 46-48 cover laws for overcoming power.\r\n\r\nThe book is based on the premise that power is a fundamental aspect of human nature and that everyone, to some extent, seeks power. The book offers advice on how to acquire and maintain power, as well as how to use it effectively and ethically. The laws are presented as historical examples of how powerful people have used them to achieve their goals.\r\n\r\nSome of the laws outlined in the book include: \"Never outshine the master,\" \"Conceal your intentions,\" \"Make other people come to you,\" \"Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant,\" \"Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim,\" \"Appear to be pure,\" and \"Create a need for your help.\"\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the book is to provide a guide for individuals who want to gain power and influence in their personal and professional lives. It is written in a practical, straightforward manner and is intended to be a reference guide for those seeking to understand the dynamics of power.', 'uthmeene', 27, 'Robert Greene', 1, 'Chapter: Never outshine the master\r\n\r\n\"The Law: Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please and impress them, do not go too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite - inspire fear and insecurity. Make your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.\r\n\r\nNever outshine the master. There is one sure way to destroy your sense of self-worth, to kill your creativity, to undermine your confidence, and to defeat your sense of independence. That is to try to outperform, outdo, or outshine those in power. This law is all about ego and insecurity. When you are in the presence of the powerful, you must always be aware of their need to feel superior. Your natural inclination will be to try to impress them by showing off your own talents and abilities. This is a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe powerful have a deep-seated need to feel superior, to be the brightest and the best. They are constantly comparing themselves to others, and they do not take kindly to those who threaten their status. If you try to outdo them, they will feel threatened and will react accordingly. They may become jealous and resentful, or they may feel the need to put you in your place. Either way, you will suffer.\r\n\r\nThe solution to this problem is simple: make those above you feel comfortably superior. This does not mean that you have to grovel or make yourself subservient. It simply means that you have to be aware of their need to feel superior and do everything you can to make them feel that way. If you can do this, you will be able to rise to the heights of power and success.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips on how to make those above you feel comfortably superior:\r\n\r\nShow your respect: The powerful need to feel respected, and one of the best ways to show respect is by paying attention to what they have to say. When they speak, listen carefully and try to understand their perspective. Show your respect by nodding your head, making eye contact, and asking questions.\r\n\r\nAvoid competition: The powerful do not like to feel threatened, and one of the quickest ways to threaten them is to try to outdo them. Avoid competing with them or trying to outshine them.

This means accepting that you are in control of your own actions, thoughts, and outcomes, and that you have the power to create the life you want.\r\n\r\nTaking 100% responsibility for your life requires a shift in perspective. It means moving from a victim mentality, where you blame others or external circumstances for your problems, to an empowered mentality, where you see yourself as the creator of your own reality.\r\n\r\nThis shift can be challenging, especially if you have been conditioned to believe that you are not in control of your life. But it is essential if you want to achieve success. Here are a few reasons why:\r\n\r\nWhen you take 100% responsibility for your life, you are no longer at the mercy of external circumstances. You are in control of your own destiny.\r\nTaking responsibility empowers you to take action and make positive changes in your life. It gives you the freedom to choose your own path and create the life you want.\r\nWhen you take responsibility for your life, you develop self-confidence and self-esteem. You recognize that you have the power and ability to create the life you want.\r\nTaking responsibility also means taking ownership of your mistakes and learning from them. This helps you grow and improve as a person.\r\nSo how do you take 100% responsibility for your life? Here are a few tips:\r\n\r\nAccept that you are in control of your life: Recognize that you are the architect of your own reality. You have the power to choose your thoughts, actions, and outcomes.\r\nStop blaming others: Instead of blaming others for your problems, take a look at your own role in creating them. This doesn\'t mean that you are to blame for everything that goes wrong in your life, but it does mean that you have the power to change things.\r\nTake ownership of your mistakes: When things go wrong, don\'t try to blame others or make excuses. Instead, take ownership of your mistakes and learn from them. This will help you grow and improve as a person.\r\nMake a commitment to change: If you want to create a different life, you have to be willing to make changes. This means taking action and making the necessary adjustments to your thoughts, actions, and habits.\r\nBy taking 100% responsibility for your life, you can create the reality you want and achieve the success you desire.

It was published in 2018 and has become a popular resource for those looking to improve their habits and make lasting change in their lives. The central idea of the book is that small, incremental changes in habits can lead to significant improvements over time.\r\n\r\nThe book is divided into four main sections:\r\n\r\nThe first section of the book explains the concept of atomic habits and how they work. Clear defines atomic habits as \"the compound effect of many small decisions: the long-term benefit of dramatic change that is produced by the accumulation of many seemingly insignificant actions.\" He argues that it is often the small, seemingly insignificant habits that we engage in on a daily basis that have the biggest impact on our lives.\r\n\r\nThe second section of the book focuses on how to build good habits and break bad ones. Clear discusses the importance of setting clear goals and creating a system for tracking progress. He also introduces the concept of \"habit stacking,\" which involves linking a new habit to an existing one in order to make it easier to remember and integrate into your daily routine.\r\n\r\nThe third section of the book explores the role of identity in shaping our habits. Clear argues that our habits are an expression of our identity, and that by shifting our identity, we can more easily adopt new habits and break old ones.\r\n\r\nThe final section of the book discusses how to apply the principles of atomic habits to various areas of our lives, including work, relationships, and health. Clear provides practical tips and strategies for using atomic habits to make lasting changes in these areas.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, Clear provides numerous examples and case studies to illustrate the principles he is discussing, and he offers a number of practical exercises and tools that readers can use to start building better habits in their own lives. The book has received widespread praise for its clear and practical approach to habit change, and it has become a popular resource for those looking to improve their lives and achieve their goals.', 'uthmeene', 27, 'James Clear', 1, 'The Fifth Rule: Use the Habit Loop\r\n\r\nThe Habit Loop is a three-step process that forms the basis of all habits. It consists of a cue, a routine, and a reward.\r\n\r\nThe cue is the trigger for the habit. It is the thing that initiates the habit. For example, if you have a habit of checking your phone as soon as you wake up in the morning, the cue might be the sound of your alarm going off.\r\n\r\nThe routine is the actual habit itself. It is the behavior you perform in response to the cue. In the example of checking your phone as soon as you wake up, the routine is picking up your phone and scrolling through your notifications.\r\n\r\nThe reward is the positive outcome you get from performing the habit. It is the thing that reinforces the habit and makes you want to do it again in the future. In the example of checking your phone, the reward might be the satisfaction of seeing that you have new messages or notifications.\r\n\r\nThe Habit Loop is important because it explains how habits are formed and maintained. When you perform a habit, your brain releases a chemical called dopamine, which gives you a feeling of pleasure. This reinforces the habit and makes you more likely to do it again in the future.\r\n\r\nThe key to building good habits and breaking bad ones is to understand and manipulate the Habit Loop. By identifying the cue, routine, and reward for a particular habit, you can change any aspect of the habit to make it more or less likely to occur.               \r\n\r\n<u>All rights reserved for the author ¬© James Clear</u>\r\n                ', 'The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits\r\nThe First Law: Make it Obvious\r\nThe Second Law: Make it Attractive\r\nThe Third Law: Make it Easy\r\nThe Fourth Law: Make it Satisfying\r\nThe First Rule: Use Habit Stacking\r\nThe Second Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule\r\nThe Third Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework\r\nThe Fourth Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule\r\nThe Fifth Rule: Use the Habit Loop\r\nThe Sixth Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every New Habit\r\nThe Seventh Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every New Habit\r\nThe Eighth Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every New Habit\r\nThe Ninth Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every New Habit\r\nThe Tenth Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Eleventh Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Twelfth Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Thirteenth Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Fourteenth Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Fifteenth Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Sixteenth Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Seventeenth Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every Habit\r\nThe Eighteenth Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every Habit\r\nThe Nineteenth Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every Habit\r\nThe Twentieth Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every Habit\r\nThe Twenty-First Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every New Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Second Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every New Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Third Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every New Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Fourth Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every New Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Fifth Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Sixth Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Seventh Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Eighth Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every Old Habit\r\nThe Twenty-Ninth Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every Habit\r\nThe Thirtieth Rule: Use the Four-Law Framework for Every Habit\r\nThe Thirty-First Rule: Use the One-Percent Rule for Every Habit\r\nThe Thirty-Second Rule: Use the Habit Loop for Every Habit\r\nThe Thirty-Third Rule: Use the Two-Minute Rule for Every New Habit\r\nThe Thirty-Fourth', 'Looking to improve your life and reach your goals?

Most people have been trained to think in terms of either/or: either you win or I win; or you lose and I win. This kind of thinking is based on power and position rather than on principle.\r\n\r\nWin-win is based on the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person\'s success is not achieved at the expense or exclusion of the success of others.\r\n\r\nWin-win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It\'s not your way or my way; it\'s a better way, a higher way.\r\n\r\nWin-win is a state of harmony, a cooperation that allows both parties to feel good about the decision and the relationship. It is the highest form of interpersonal relations.\r\n\r\nWin-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitive arena. Win-win is not a technique; it\'s a total philosophy of human interaction. In win-win, both parties feel good about the decision and feel committed to the action plan. Both feel responsible for the implementation and the results. Win-win is teamwork.\r\n\r\nWin-win requires the Abundance Mentality, the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to share with others. Most people are deeply scripted in the Scarcity Mentality. They see life as having only so much, as though there were only one pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it would mean less for everybody else.\r\n\r\nThe Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flows out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and security. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. It results in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making. It opens possibilities, options, alternatives, and creativity.\"              \r\n\r\n<u>All rights reserved for the author ¬©  </u>\r\n                ', 'Habit 1: Be Proactive\r\nHabit 2: Begin with the End in Mind\r\nHabit 3: Put First Things First\r\nHabit 4: Think Win-Win\r\nHabit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood\r\nHabit 6: Synergize\r\nHabit 7: Sharpen the Saw', 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is a self-help book written by Stephen R.

It is a mindset that tells us that there is not enough time, money, or resources to go around, and that we have to compete with others in order to get what we want.\r\n\r\nA scarcity mindset is a negative mindset that causes us to focus on what we don\'t have, rather than on what we do have. It is a mindset that causes us to feel stressed and anxious, and that makes us feel like we are constantly fighting an uphill battle.\r\n\r\nAn abundance mindset, on the other hand, is a positive mindset that allows us to focus on what we do have, rather than on what we don\'t have. It is a mindset that allows us to feel grateful and thankful, and that makes us feel like we are constantly blessed with abundance.\r\n\r\nAn abundance mindset is a mindset that allows us to see the world as a place of abundance, rather than as a place of scarcity.

Postman contends that this shift in focus has led to a decline in the quality of education and a devaluation of knowledge and culture. He also argues that the modern American education system is failing to prepare students for the challenges of living in a rapidly changing and increasingly complex world.\r\n\r\nThroughout the book, Postman examines the various issues and challenges facing education today, such as the emphasis on consumerism and the proliferation of technology, and offers a compelling argument for why education should be focused on the transmission of knowledge and culture, rather than simply preparing students for the workforce.

He may also talk about the role of education in society, discussing the importance of cultural literacy and the dangers of a society in which education is only seen as a means to an end.\r\n\r\nLater chapters may delve into specific issues such as the effects of the shift to a \"job-training\" model of education, the role of media and entertainment in the education system, and the future of education. Each chapter is likely to explore these issues in depth, offering new perspectives and insights that will leave readers rethinking their own beliefs about education.\r\n\r\nThe book is not just a critique of the current state of education, but an invitation to participate in the conversation of what should education be and how can we achieve it.

He argues that technology has made it possible for us to access a vast amount of information quickly and easily, but it has also led to a decline in our ability to think critically and creatively. He also points out that technology has changed the way we communicate, with an emphasis on short, superficial messages rather than on deep, meaningful conversations.\r\n\r\nHe also argues that the use of technology in the classroom has led to a decline in the quality of education.

He argues that technology is not neutral and that it has the power to shape the way we think and the way we learn. He also points out that the use of technology in the classroom can have unintended consequences, such as the creation of a generation of \"technological barbarians\" who are ill-equipped to deal with the challenges of the modern world.\r\n\r\nPostman concludes the chapter by arguing that the use of technology in the classroom should be reevaluated and that education should focus on the development of critical thinking and creativity.

The author explains how people are often driven by a sense of scarcity, and how this mindset can lead to poor financial decisions and a lack of satisfaction with one\'s life.\r\n\r\nThe author begins by discussing how people\'s financial goals often change as they acquire more wealth. He states that people tend to believe that more money will bring more happiness and satisfaction, but in reality, this is not always the case. He points out that once people attain a certain level of wealth, their goals tend to shift from \"having enough\" to \"wanting more.\"\r\n\r\nThe author also explores how people\'s relationship with money changes over time, and how the things that once seemed important may become less so as priorities change. For example, he states that when people are young and starting out, they may be focused on earning enough money to pay for basic necessities, such as housing and food. As they get older and accumulate more wealth, their focus may shift to saving for retirement or funding their children\'s education.\r\n\r\nHousel also highlights the concept of lifestyle inflation, which is the tendency of people to increase their spending as their income increases. He explains that as people earn more money, they are often tempted to upgrade their lifestyles, which can lead to higher expenses and a greater need for more money. He also points out that this can be a trap, as people may find themselves working harder and harder to maintain their standard of living, and may never feel like they have enough.\r\n\r\nThe author also touches on how people\'s relationship with money can be affected by their upbringing and the culture they live in. He states that some cultures place a greater emphasis on saving and investing, while others may be more focused on spending and enjoying the present. He also notes that people who grow up in households where money is scarce may develop a mindset of scarcity and may always feel like they don\'t have enough, regardless of how much they earn.\r\n\r\nOverall, the chapter \"Never Enough\" in \"The Psychology of Money\" by Morgan Housel provides a detailed overview of how people\'s relationship with money can change over time, and how the human tendency to always want more can lead to poor financial decisions and a lack of satisfaction with one\'s life. He provides some insights and strategies for breaking out of this cycle of scarcity and finding contentment with one\'s financial situation.\r\n\r\n<div class=\'note\'>Please note that the above text is not exact excerpt but summaries of The chapter \"Never Enough\" .</div>\r\n<u>All rights reserved for the author ¬© </u>\r\n                ', 'No One\'s Crazy\r\nLuck & Risk\r\nNever Enough\r\nConfounding Compounding\r\nGetting Wealthy vs. Staying Wealthy\r\nTails, You Win\r\nFreedom\r\nMan in the Mirror\r\nThe Deprived Brain\r\nThe Social Animal\r\nThe Future\'s Not What It Used To Be\r\nThe End\r\nThe Next Step', '\"The Psychology of Money\" is a book written by Morgan Housel that was published in 2020.

He had then been sent to the school of the Oratorians, had subsequently entered the seminary, and had finally become a priest.\r\n\r\nHis extreme poverty had made him eccentric. In his eyes, all men were equal, and he was fond of saying, \'I belong to nobody and to everybody.\' In 1793, the year of the taking of the Bastille, he had been a member of the Convention; he had voted for the death of Louis XVI, which was, in his opinion, a political necessity, and had immediately afterwards retired from public life, a ruined man.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventy-five, he was still a man of great simplicity of mind, upright and good-hearted. When he arrived at D‚Äî‚Äî he was an old man, and his aspect was such as to attract attention. He was known to be a man of virtue; but, as is always the case, the men of business who are not of the clergy, the capitalists who are not philanthropists, the tax-payers who are not democrats, soon shook their heads, and declared that the Bishop was \'a Pharisee.\'\"\r\n\r\n<div class=\'note\'>Book 3, Chapter 1 \"The Grandfather and the Grandson\"</div>\r\n\"The ancient household of Gillenormand was still in existence.

He still wore a powdered wig, a little too large, which made him look like a judge from the days of Louis XV.\r\n\r\nAt his age he still had something of the child about him, and of the old roisterer. He would suddenly break out into laughter, and then suddenly become serious again. He was somewhat deaf, but he heard when he wanted to hear. He saw everything through the glasses of his own egotism. He considered himself to be in the right in all things, and he spoke with an unshaken confidence which sometimes admitted of no reply.\r\n\r\nHe was an old man who had been a lover and a gallant in his youth, who had made a great many love affairs, who had run through a great deal of money, who had been in a great many duels, and who had received four shots in his body.\r\n\r\nHe had lived in the time of libertinage, of free-thinking, of wit, of the Empire, of the Restoration, and of the elder branch.
